This is the cleaning-robots folder from the examples provided in the Jason
distribution, with some additional files:

r1_v1.asl
r1_v2.asl
r1_v3.asl
r1_v4.asl

These are simpler versions of the code provided in r1.asl, as control 
programs for that garbage collecting robot.

The idea is that when viewed sequentially they provide a series of steps
towards the development of the full program, suitable for not-so-confident
agent programmers.

There is no significant new content in these programs, compared with
what you saw in the lectures, just a few additional comments.

If you want to run these programs, you will have to edit the mars.mas2j file.
